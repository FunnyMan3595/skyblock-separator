## Contribution process

### Code Reviews

Code reviews are cool! If you want to contribute, submit a
[GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and
I'll happily review it for inclusion. I'd love to get my own code reviewed as
well, but since it's just me writing this, I can't. If you spot something in my
code that you think I could do better, please file an issue on this repository,
and I'll take a look!
